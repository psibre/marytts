German unit selection: MARY 3.1beta2 released

	Here's another snapshot release of the work on unit selection: {{{http://mary.dfki.de/download/mary-install-3.1beta2.jar}http://mary.dfki.de/download/mary-install-3.1beta2.jar}}

	
	Highlights:

	* Four German unit selection voices created from recordings in the BITS project;
	
	* added acoustic models, which should also improve the English unit selection voices;
	
	* added support for 64-bit linux and Intel Mac architectures.

	[]
	
	On our to-do list are still many things, including:

	* a well-documented and easy-to-use voice creation toolkit;

	* smaller voices by using suitable speech coding for the databases.
