	This is a feature release, adding new features while maintaining compatibility with existing 4.x voices.

	This release marks the final results of work on MARY TTS in the {{{http://mary.dfki.de/pavoque}PAVOQUE project}}, in which we experimented with different technologies for adding expressivity to unit selection synthesis. The release makes available those project results that may be of interest to a wider audience.
